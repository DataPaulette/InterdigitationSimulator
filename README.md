# Strip Pattern Generator

## What?

This repo is used to characterize different sensor patterns.
Here is an illustration of what is simulated:
![alt tag](animation.gif)

- The white circle is a simulated finger
- The thick histogram lines represent simulated raw data from a virtual sensor
- The thin histogram lines are an interpolation of this data
- The grey circle is a retrieval attempt of the finger position from this data

## How?

To run the .pde program, it just needs the [Processind IDE](https://processing.org/download/)
You can edit the 1st variables to get your custom patterns.

## Note

This project started to generate patterns to etch conductive fabrics that are used in the [eTextile matrix sensor project](http://eTextile.org).
The etching process have been chosen to explore complex matrix design in order to experiment a new analog interpolation technique.
The etching tutorial can be found on the [DataPaulette eTextile hakerspace wiki](http://wiki.datapaulette.org/doku.php/atelier/documentation/materiautheque/materiaux/electronique_textile/connectique/circuits_souples)
