# Strip Pattern Generator

## Wat?

This software is made to generate a pattern used to etching conductives fabrics that are used into the [eTextile matrix sensor project](http://eTextile.org).
The etching process have been chosen to explore complex matrix design in order to exeriment a new analog interpolation technique.
The etching tutorial can be found on the [DataPaulette eTextile hakerspace wiki](http://wiki.datapaulette.org/doku.php/atelier/documentation/materiautheque/materiaux/electronique_textile/connectique/circuits_souples)

## How?

To run the .pde program, it just needs the [Processind IDE](https://processing.org/download/)
You can edit the 1st variables to get your custom patterns.
After running it, a .pdf file is generated, use "ctrl + s" to save it.
Here is an example of what is generated:
